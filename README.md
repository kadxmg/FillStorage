# FillStorage
A simple tool to fill your android phone's storage.

This tool is used for testing to determine if the space reserved by the system will work after the third-party application fills up the available space on the phone. Otherwise it will restart and cannot be turned on. (In AOSP, zygote needs 50M space to boot)
